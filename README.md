# Hi, I'm Parsa! 👋

I'm a **Computer Engineering student** currently locked-in on **AI**.

---

## 🌱 What I'm Focused On

My current exploration centers around the rapidly evolving world of AI, especially:

* 🧠 **Open Source AI Models:** Exploring the ecosystem beyond closed-source solutions.
* 💻 **Local LLMs:** Running and experimenting with models directly on my machine.
* 🔧 **Fine-Tuning & LoRA:** Understanding and applying techniques to adapt models for specific tasks.
* 🎮 **AI in Game Development:** Investigating the current state of AI in game dev.

I believe in the power of open collaboration and enjoy diving deep into how these technologies work under the hood.

## 🛠️ Tech & Skills

* **Languages:** Python (AI/ML), JavaScript (Web/Game Dev), C/C++ (from Comp Eng studies)
* **AI/ML:** LLMs, Fine-Tuning Concepts, LoRA, Prompt Engineering
* **OS & Tools:** Linux (Daily Driver!), Git, Docker (for local model environments)
* **Concepts:** Game Development Principles, Computer Engineering Fundamentals, Open Source Contribution

## ✨ Featured Project

* **🎮 Tower Gridlock:** (https://github.com/Corelarc/Tower-Gridlock)
    * A JavaScript-based tower defense game built *entirely* using AI prompts (like ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini). This project was a fascinating experiment in leveraging generative AI for code generation, logic implementation, and iterative game design. It demonstrates the potential (and quirks!) of AI-assisted development.
